#Script pulls a list of hosts from hosts.txt and uses Test-Connection function on each host. 
#The result for each host is written to a timestamped text file with a count of online machines at the bottom
#Another script will compare the text files to expose consistently offline machines
#Could be tailored to run in certain time windows by scheduling when the script runs
